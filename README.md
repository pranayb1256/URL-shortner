# URL-shortner
A URL shortener is a service that converts long URLs into shorter, more manageable links. These shorter URLs are typically more user-friendly, easier to share on social media or in print, and often include tracking and analytics features.

When a shortened URL is clicked, it redirects the user to the original, longer URL. URL shorteners work by storing the original URL in a database and associating it with a unique, abbreviated identifier, which becomes the short link.

Some key features and benefits of URL shorteners include:

Convenience: Shorter links are easier to share, especially on platforms with character limits like Twitter.
Analytics: Many URL shorteners provide insights on how many clicks a link receives, where the clicks come from, and other engagement metrics.
Customization: Some services allow you to create custom short URLs that reflect your brand or content.
Redirection management: You can change the destination URL without altering the short link, which is useful for campaigns and temporary redirects.
